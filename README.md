# Text-Adventure-Game-Python
How to build a basic text adventure game in Python using UDFs and loops only. 


About the game:
One Way Out is a self-written fictional story. It's what happens when you take one famous movie; Total Recall, and an equally famous (debatable) hit sitcom; Castle, and combine them. 

You are either Douglas Quaid or Karl Hauser. One is an average Joe and the other is a special forces veteran. For anyone unfamiliar with the movie, Total Recall is set in the future and Rekall is a company that implants artificial memories for those looking to escape the mundane responsibilities of their life. 
    
In this game you start within Douglas's/Karl's dream and, you are the protagonist and it's your job to get out of this labyrinth of rooms, all the while trying to remember who you are or how you got here. 

You win, when you escape from your captors and exit the dream.

Happy playing!
